              I design and build interactive learning experiences that drive
              measurable outcomes. From branching scenarios in Articulate Storyline
              to custom web-based simulations, my work centers on scenario-based
              learning, meaningful feedback loops, and learner-centered evaluation —
              combining instructional design expertise with hands-on development skills.
            </p>
            <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              My background in game design shapes how I think about engagement,
              learner agency, and feedback loops — every interaction should feel
              purposeful. An MS in Instructional Design grounds that instinct in
              evidence-based practice: clear learning objectives, authentic
              assessments, and iterative design informed by research.
            </p>
            <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
              I bring ideas to life as functional prototypes, not wireframes, so
              stakeholders can experience the learning before it ships. My toolkit
              includes Articulate Storyline, Articulate Rise, React, TypeScript,
              Astro, and Twine — applied in service of learning, not technology for
              its own sake.
