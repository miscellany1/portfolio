              I design and build interactive learning experiences that drive
              measurable outcomes. My work focuses on scenario-based learning,
              meaningful feedback loops, and learner-centered evaluation — combining
              instructional design expertise with hands-on development skills.
            </p>
            <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Every project I create is grounded in evidence-based practice: clear
              learning objectives, authentic assessments, and iterative design. I
              bring ideas to life as fully functional prototypes — not just
              wireframes — so stakeholders can experience the learning before it
              ships.
            </p>
            <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
              Tools I work with include React, TypeScript, Astro, and modern web
              frameworks — applied in service of learning, not technology for its own
              sake.
